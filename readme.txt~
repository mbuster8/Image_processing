This application serves as an debugging tool to any applicaiton working with images using OpenCV library. Using visual_debug auxiliary library we are able to send an image which is represented in cv::Mat data structure. This library's public function "send_image" offers an interface between the main application and our debugging tool in which an image sent from the main application will be displayed. "Send_image" function codes image data into the best suitable format using least possible dependencies (using standard library and ZeroMQ library). Subsequently these data are wrapped into a package and sent through a socket into debugging tool. In the debugging tool we receive a packege containing image data, encode it and display on the main window. We are able to perform basic action over the displayed image - zooming using mouse scroller, viewing actual pixel's RGB values and pixel's position within the displayed image.
