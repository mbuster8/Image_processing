This application serves as an debugging tool to any applicaiton working with iamges using OpenCV library. Using vuseal_debug auxillary library we are able to send an image represented in cv::Mat data structure. This library's public sunction send_image offers and interface between main application and debugging tool in which sent image will be displayed. Send_image function codes image data into best suitable format using less possible dependencies (using standard library and ZeroMQ library). Subsequently these data are wraped into a package and sent via sockets into debugging tool. In debugging tool we receive a packege conatining image data, encode it and display omn the main window. We are able to perform basic action over the displayed image - zooming using mouse scroller, and viewing actual pixel RGB values and it's position within the displayed image.
