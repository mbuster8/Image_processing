This application serves as an debugging tool to any applicaiton working with images using OpenCV library. Using "visual_debug" auxiliary library we are able to send an image represented in cv::Mat data structure. This library's public function "send_image" offers and interface between main application and the debugging tool in which sent image will be displayed. "Send_image" function encodes image data into the best suitable format using the least possible dependencies (using standard library and ZeroMQ library). Subsequently these data are wrapped into a package and sent through a socket into the debugging tool. In the debugging tool we receive a packege containing image data, decode it and display on the main window of the debugging tool. We are able to perform some basic actions over the displayed image - zooming using mouse scroller,viewing actual pixel's RGB values and it's position within the displayed image.
